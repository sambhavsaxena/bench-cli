## `bench new`

Scaffolds a starter `bench.yml` in the current directory.

**Pre-conditions:** No `bench.yml` exists in the current directory.

**Steps:**
1. Check that no `bench.yml` exists. If one exists, print an error and exit.
2. Write a minimal `bench.yml` with placeholder values to the current directory.
3. Print a message telling the user to edit the file and then run `bench init`.

**Does not** touch the filesystem beyond writing `bench.yml`.

---

## `bench init`

Installs and configures the entire environment described in `bench.yml`. Safe to re-run — each step checks whether it has already been done.

### Pre-conditions

- `bench.yml` exists and is valid.
- The process has `sudo` access (required for `apt-get`).

### Steps

```
1.  Validate bench.yml
2.  Install system packages
3.  Create bench directory structure
4.  Create Python virtualenv
5.  Clone apps
6.  Install Python dependencies
7.  Install Node.js
8.  Configure MariaDB
9.  Configure Redis
10. Create sites
11. Install apps on sites
12. Generate Procfile
```

#### Step 1 — Validate bench.yml

`BenchConfig.from_file('bench.yml')` runs all validation rules. On failure, print the error and exit with code 1. No filesystem changes have occurred at this point.

#### Step 2 — Install system packages

`MariaDBManager.install()` and `RedisManager.install()` each check `is_installed()` first and skip if already present.

Packages installed via `apt-get`:
- `mariadb-server`
- `redis-server`
- `python3-<version>` and `python3-<version>-venv` (from deadsnakes PPA if needed)
- `git`
- `libmysqlclient-dev` (required to build the `mysqlclient` Python package)

After installation, `MariaDBManager.start()` ensures the service is running.

#### Step 3 — Create bench directory structure

`Bench.create_directories()` creates:
- `apps/`
- `sites/`
- `sites/assets/`
- `logs/`
- `config/`
- `pids/`

All created with `exist_ok=True`.

#### Step 4 — Create Python virtualenv

`PythonEnvManager.create_venv()` runs:
```
python3.<version> -m venv env/
```
Skipped if `env/bin/python` already exists.

#### Step 5 — Clone apps

For each `AppConfig` in order:
- Skip if `App.is_cloned` is already `True`.
- `App.clone()` runs:
  ```
  git clone <repo> --branch <branch> --depth 1 apps/<name>
  ```

#### Step 6 — Install Python dependencies

For each `App` in order:
- `PythonEnvManager.install_app(app)` runs:
  ```
  env/bin/pip install -e apps/<name>
  ```
- This installs the app and all its `requirements.txt` dependencies.

#### Step 7 — Install Node.js

`PythonEnvManager.install_node()` checks if `node` is present. If not, installs Node.js 18 LTS via the NodeSource setup script.

Yarn is installed globally afterward: `npm install -g yarn`.

#### Step 8 — Configure MariaDB

For each `SiteConfig`:
- `MariaDBManager.create_database(site.db_name)` — `CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS`.
- `MariaDBManager.create_user(site.db_name, site.db_password, site.db_name)` — creates a user with the same name as the database and grants it full access to that database.

#### Step 9 — Configure Redis

`RedisManager.generate_configs()` writes three files to `config/`:

**`redis_cache.conf`**
```
port 13000
bind 127.0.0.1
save ""
```

**`redis_queue.conf`**
```
port 11000
bind 127.0.0.1
```

**`redis_socketio.conf`**
```
port 12000
bind 127.0.0.1
```

Existing files are overwritten.

#### Step 10 — Create sites

For each `SiteConfig`, if `Site.exists` is `False`:
- `Site.create(mariadb_config)` runs the framework app's `new-site` command:
  ```
  env/bin/bench new-site <site.name>
      --mariadb-root-password <root_password>
      --db-name <site.db_name>
      --db-password <site.db_password>
      --no-mariadb-socket
  ```

Skipped if the site directory already contains `site_config.json`.

#### Step 11 — Install apps on sites

For each `SiteConfig`, for each app in `site.apps` (in order):
- `Site.install_app(app_name)` runs:
  ```
  env/bin/bench --site <site.name> install-app <app_name>
  ```
- `frappe` is always already installed by `new-site`; skip it to avoid a harmless but confusing error.

#### Step 12 — Generate process manager config

`ProcessManagerFactory.create(bench)` returns the right manager based on `bench.config.process_manager`, then `generate_config()` is called.

**When `process_manager: honcho`** — writes `config/Procfile`:

```
web: env/bin/gunicorn -b 0.0.0.0:8000 -w 1 -t 120 frappe.app:application
socketio: node apps/frappe/socketio.js
worker_default_1: env/bin/bench worker --queue default
worker_default_2: env/bin/bench worker --queue default
worker_short_1: env/bin/bench worker --queue short
worker_long_1: env/bin/bench worker --queue long
redis_cache: redis-server config/redis_cache.conf
redis_queue: redis-server config/redis_queue.conf
redis_socketio: redis-server config/redis_socketio.conf
```

**When `process_manager: supervisor`** — writes `config/supervisor.conf` with one `[program:X]` section per process (see architecture.md for the full template). This step does **not** start supervisord; that is done by `bench run`.

---

## `bench run`

Starts all bench processes using whichever process manager is configured.

### Pre-conditions

- `bench init` has been run at least once (the process manager config file exists).
- MariaDB service is running on the host.

### Steps

```
1.  Validate bench.yml
2.  Check process manager config exists
3.  Start processes
```

#### Step 1 — Validate bench.yml

Same as in `bench init`. Exit on error.

#### Step 2 — Check config exists

`ProcessManagerFactory.create(bench)` selects the manager. If the expected config file is missing (`config/Procfile` for honcho, `config/supervisor.conf` for supervisor), print a message telling the user to run `bench init` first and exit with code 1.

#### Step 3 — Start processes

**With honcho (`process_manager: honcho`)**

`HonchoProcessManager.start()` invokes honcho programmatically (via its Python API, not subprocess) with `config/Procfile` as input.

- All process output is multiplexed to stdout with a `<process-name> |` prefix.
- Each process also writes its output to `logs/<process-name>.log`.
- `bench run` **blocks** — it stays in the foreground until the user sends `SIGINT` (Ctrl-C).
- On `SIGINT`, honcho sends `SIGTERM` to all child processes and waits up to 5 seconds before sending `SIGKILL`.

**With supervisor (`process_manager: supervisor`)**

`SupervisorProcessManager.start()` sets the `BENCH_ROOT` environment variable to the bench root path, then:

- If supervisord is **not** running: `supervisord -c config/supervisor.conf`
- If supervisord **is** running (socket exists and responds): `supervisorctl -c config/supervisor.conf reload`

`bench run` **exits immediately** after this. Supervisord runs as a background daemon; process output goes to the per-process log files under `logs/`.

To inspect running processes: `supervisorctl -c config/supervisor.conf status`

To stop all processes: `supervisorctl -c config/supervisor.conf shutdown`

---

## `bench build`

Builds JavaScript and CSS assets for all installed apps.

### Pre-conditions

- `bench init` has been run (apps are cloned, Node.js is installed, virtualenv exists).

### Steps

```
1.  Validate bench.yml
2.  For each app, build assets
3.  Copy built assets to sites/assets/
```

#### Step 2 — Per-app asset build

`App.build_assets()` checks whether the app has a `package.json` at its root.

- If yes: `yarn --cwd apps/<name> build` (or the build script defined in `package.json`).
- If no: skip silently.

#### Step 3 — Copy to sites/assets/

After all per-app builds complete, run the framework app's asset collection command:
```
env/bin/bench build --make-copy
```
This collects all built assets into `sites/assets/`.

---

## `bench update`

Pulls the latest commits for all apps, reinstalls Python packages, and migrates all sites.

### Pre-conditions

- `bench init` has been run.
- All processes are stopped (warn the user if any Procfile processes are detected running).

### Steps

```
1.  Validate bench.yml
2.  Warn if processes are running
3.  For each app: git pull
4.  For each app: pip install -e
5.  For each site: bench migrate
```

#### Step 2 — Warn if processes are running

Call `ProcessManagerFactory.create(bench).is_running()`. If it returns `True`, print a warning (not an error) and ask the user to confirm before continuing. In non-interactive mode (`--yes` flag), skip the prompt and proceed.

#### Step 3 — git pull for each app

`App.update()` runs:
```
git -C apps/<name> fetch origin
git -C apps/<name> merge --ff-only origin/<branch>
```

Fast-forward only. If a merge conflict would occur, print an error for that app and skip it (continue with remaining apps).

#### Step 4 — pip install -e for each app

`PythonEnvManager.install_app(app)` re-runs `pip install -e apps/<name>` to pick up any new Python dependencies added to the app since the last update.

#### Step 5 — bench migrate for each site

`Site.migrate()` runs:
```
env/bin/bench --site <site.name> migrate
```

Runs in order for each site. If migration fails on one site, print the error and continue with remaining sites. Exit with a non-zero code at the end if any migration failed.

## `bench setup nginx`

See [specs/production.md](production.md) for the full step-by-step.

**Summary:** Installs nginx if absent, generates per-site config files into `config/nginx/`, symlinks `include.conf` into `nginx.config_dir`, validates with `nginx -t`, and reloads nginx.

Pre-conditions: `nginx.enabled: true`, `bench init` has been run, process has `sudo`.

---

## `bench setup letsencrypt`

See [specs/production.md](production.md) for the full step-by-step.

**Summary:** Installs certbot if absent, ensures the webroot directory exists, runs `certbot certonly --webroot` for each `ssl: true` site (with all domains as `-d` arguments), then regenerates nginx config with HTTPS blocks and reloads nginx.

Pre-conditions: `bench setup nginx` has run, nginx is serving port 80, DNS records for all SSL sites point to this server.

---

## `bench setup production`

See [specs/production.md](production.md) for the full step-by-step.

**Summary:** Validates that `process_manager` is `supervisor`, writes `dns_multitenant: 1` to `sites/common_site_config.json`, sets up supervisor, then runs `bench setup nginx` and `bench setup letsencrypt` in sequence.

---

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `0` | Success |
| `1` | Configuration error or expected failure (printed to stderr) |
| `2` | Unexpected error (printed with traceback if `--verbose`) |

---

## Common flags

All commands accept:

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--bench-dir PATH` | Override the directory containing `bench.yml`. Default: search upward from `$CWD`. |
| `--verbose` | Print full tracebacks on error and all subprocess output. |
| `--yes` | Skip confirmation prompts (useful in CI). |
