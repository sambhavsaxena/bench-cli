# Commands Specification

---

## `bench new`

Scaffolds a starter `bench.toml` inside a new bench directory.

**Pre-conditions:** No bench directory with the given name exists under `benches/`.

**Steps:**
1. Check that `benches/<name>/` does not already exist. If it does, print an error and exit.
2. Create `benches/<name>/`.
3. Write a minimal `bench.toml` with placeholder values to `benches/<name>/bench.toml`.
4. Print a message telling the user to edit the file and then run `bench init`.

**Does not** touch the filesystem beyond creating the directory and writing `bench.toml`.

---

## `bench init`

Installs and configures the entire environment described in `bench.toml`. Safe to re-run — each step checks whether it has already been done.

### Pre-conditions

- `bench.toml` exists and is valid.
- **Ubuntu:** The process has `sudo` access (required for `apt-get`).
- **macOS:** Homebrew is installed (`brew` is in `$PATH`). No `sudo` required — Homebrew installs to user-owned directories.

### Passwordless sudo setup (optional)

```
bench init --sudo-password <password>
```

Passing `--sudo-password` writes a sudoers drop-in at `/etc/sudoers.d/<user>` so that `apt-get`, `nginx`, `systemctl`, `loginctl`, `ln`, `unlink`, `zpool`, `zfs`, and `rsync` can all run without a password prompt during and after setup.

**The password is never stored.** It is forwarded directly to `sudo -S tee` in a single subprocess call and discarded immediately. Nothing is written to disk, logged, or retained in memory beyond that call.

The sudoers file grants `NOPASSWD` only for the specific commands bench manages:

```
<user> ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/apt-get
<user> ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/nginx
<user> ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/systemctl
<user> ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/loginctl
<user> ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/ln
<user> ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/unlink
<user> ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/zpool
<user> ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/zfs
<user> ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/rsync
```

The write is idempotent — if all of these rules are already present in the file, the step is skipped entirely.

If the `IS_SUDOERS_SETUP` environment variable is set, `bench init` assumes the sudoers file is already in place and skips the step without asking for a password. This is the expected state in CI and managed deployments where the file is provisioned externally.

### Steps

```
0.  Configure passwordless sudo (only when --sudo-password is given and IS_SUDOERS_SETUP is unset)
1.  Validate bench.toml
2.  Install system packages
2b. Set up ZFS volumes (Linux only — mandatory) — resolves backing = "auto"
    by discovering an unused disk (or falling back to a disk image) and persists the
    resolved values to bench.toml; see docs/volume.md
3.  Create bench directory structure
4.  Create Python virtualenv
5.  Clone and install framework app
6.  Install Node.js
7.  Install Node.js dependencies
8.  Configure Redis
9.  Generate Procfile
```

#### Step 1 — Validate bench.toml

`BenchConfig.from_file('bench.toml')` runs all validation rules. On failure, print the error and exit with code 1. No filesystem changes have occurred at this point.

#### Step 2 — Install system packages

`MariaDBManager.install()` and `RedisManager.install()` each check `is_installed()` first and skip if already present. The package manager is selected by `get_package_manager()` from `bench_cli.platform`.

**Ubuntu (apt):**
- `mariadb-server`
- `redis-server`
- `python3-<version>` and `python3-<version>-venv` (from deadsnakes PPA if needed)
- `git`

**macOS (Homebrew):**
- `mariadb`
- `redis`
- `python@<version>` (if the requested version is not already available)
- `git` (usually pre-installed via Xcode CLT)

`libmysqlclient-dev` is **not** needed on either platform — bench uses `PyMySQL`, which is pure Python and requires no C extension.

After installation, `MariaDBManager.start()` ensures the MariaDB service is running:
- Ubuntu: `systemctl start mariadb`
- macOS: `brew services start mariadb`

#### Step 3 — Create bench directory structure

`Bench.create_directories()` creates:
- `apps/`
- `sites/`
- `sites/assets/`
- `logs/`
- `config/`
- `pids/`

All created with `exist_ok=True`.

#### Step 4 — Create Python virtualenv

`PythonEnvManager.create_venv()` runs `uv venv` with the requested Python version:
```
uv venv --python <version> env/
```
`uv` is auto-installed if not present. Skipped if `env/bin/python` already exists.

#### Step 5 — Clone and install framework app

For each `AppConfig` in `bench.init_apps()` (reads from `bench.toml [[apps]]`):
- Skip if `App.is_cloned` is already `True`.
- `App.clone()` runs:
  ```
  git clone <repo> --branch <branch> --depth 1 apps/<name>
  ```
- `PythonEnvManager.install_app(app)` runs:
  ```
  uv pip install -e apps/<name>
  ```

This installs the framework app and all its dependencies. After `bench init`, additional apps are added via `bench get-app`.

#### Step 6 — Install Node.js

`PythonEnvManager.install_node()` checks if `node` is present. If not, installs Node.js 24 via the NodeSource setup script.

Yarn is installed globally afterward: `npm install -g yarn`.

#### Step 7 — Install Node.js dependencies

`PythonEnvManager.install_node_dependencies()` runs `yarn install` for each app in `apps/` that has a `package.json`.

#### Step 8 — Configure Redis

`RedisManager.generate_configs()` writes config files to `config/`. The output depends on whether single-instance or multi-instance mode is used.

**Single-instance mode** (`redis.port` is set):

**`redis.conf`**
```
port 13000
bind 127.0.0.1
```

**Multi-instance mode** (`cache_port`/`queue_port`):

**`redis_cache.conf`** / **`redis_queue.conf`**
```
port <N>
bind 127.0.0.1
```

There is no dedicated socketio Redis — socketio shares the cache instance, so
`common_site_config.json` sets `redis_socketio` equal to `redis_cache`.

Existing files are overwritten.

#### Step 9 — Generate Procfile

Writes `config/Procfile` with one line per process: web server, socketio, admin UI, workers, and Redis.

Single-instance Redis:
```
web: cd sites && env/bin/bench frappe serve --port 8000 --noreload
socketio: env/bin/python -m frappe.realtime.server  # python backend (default); runs from bench root
admin: PYTHONPATH=<cli_root> .admin-venv/bin/python -m admin.backend.server --bench-root <bench> --port 8002
worker_default_1: cd sites && env/bin/bench frappe worker --queue default
worker_default_2: cd sites && env/bin/bench frappe worker --queue default
worker_short_1: cd sites && env/bin/bench frappe worker --queue short
worker_long_1: cd sites && env/bin/bench frappe worker --queue long
redis: redis-server config/redis.conf
```

Multi-instance Redis:
```
...
redis_cache: redis-server config/redis_cache.conf
redis_queue: redis-server config/redis_queue.conf
```

On completion, prints:
```
bench init complete. Next steps:
  bench new-site site1.localhost  # create your first site
  bench start                     # start all processes
```

---

## `bench get-app`

Clones an app from a git repository and installs it into the virtualenv.

```bash
bench get-app https://github.com/frappe/erpnext --branch version-16
```

### Steps

```
1.  Clone the app
2.  Install Python dependencies
3.  Update apps.txt
```

#### Step 1 — Clone the app

`App.clone()` runs `git clone <repo> --branch <branch> --depth 1 apps/<name>`. The app name is inferred from the repository URL (last path component, without `.git`). Skipped if already cloned.

#### Step 2 — Install Python dependencies

`PythonEnvManager.install_app(app)` runs `uv pip install -e apps/<name>`.

#### Step 3 — Update apps.txt

Appends the app name to `sites/apps.txt`. Does **not** modify `bench.toml`.

---

## `bench new-site`

Creates a new Frappe site.

```bash
bench new-site site1.localhost
bench new-site site1.localhost --admin-password admin
```

### Steps

```
1.  Check site does not already exist
2.  Create the site
3.  Update common_site_config.json
```

#### Step 2 — Create the site

`Site.create(mariadb_config)` runs the framework app's `new-site` command:
```
env/bin/bench new-site <site.name>
    --mariadb-root-password <root_password>
    --admin-password <admin_password>
    --no-mariadb-socket
```

frappe generates and manages the database name and credentials internally; they are written into `sites/<name>/site_config.json`. The site directory is created on disk — it is **not** written to `bench.toml`.

#### Step 3 — Update common_site_config.json

`Bench.write_common_site_config()` rewrites `sites/common_site_config.json` with Redis URLs and the default site. Sites are discovered from the filesystem (`sites/` directory), not from `bench.toml`.

---

## `bench start`

Starts all bench processes using the built-in Procfile runner.

### Pre-conditions

- `bench init` has been run at least once (`config/Procfile` exists).
- MariaDB service is running on the host.

### Steps

```
1.  Check Procfile exists
2.  Start processes
```

#### Step 1 — Check Procfile exists

If `config/Procfile` is missing, print a message telling the user to run `bench init` first and exit with code 1.

#### Step 2 — Start processes

`ProcessManager.start()` reads `config/Procfile` and spawns each process with `subprocess.Popen`. A dedicated thread per process streams output to stdout with a color-coded `[<name>]` prefix — each process name gets a distinct ANSI color so concurrent output is easy to read. Per-process PID files are written to `pids/<name>.pid`.

The `admin:` entry in the Procfile means the admin UI is always available at `http://localhost:8002` while the bench is running.

`bench start` **blocks** — it stays in the foreground until `SIGINT` (Ctrl-C). On `SIGINT`, all child processes receive `SIGTERM` and are waited on before the parent exits.

---

## `bench stop`

Stops a running bench that was started with `bench start`.

### Steps

1. Read `pids/bench.pid`. If it does not exist, print "Bench is not running." and exit.
2. Send `SIGTERM` to the process group.
3. Remove `pids/bench.pid`.

Works across terminal sessions — the PID file is the source of truth.

---

## `bench restart`

Restarts all supervisor-managed processes. **Production mode only** — requires `nginx.enabled = true` in `bench.toml` and a supervisor config generated by `bench setup production`.

In development mode, use `bench stop` followed by `bench start` instead.

### Steps

1. Verify `nginx.enabled = true` and supervisor config exists; exit with an error if not.
2. `SupervisorProcessManager.restart()` sends a `supervisorctl restart all` to reload all processes without stopping the daemon.

---

## `bench build`

Builds JavaScript and CSS assets for all installed apps.

```bash
bench build          # download pre-built assets from GitHub releases
bench build --force  # skip download, rebuild from source
```

### Pre-conditions

- `bench init` has been run (apps are cloned, Node.js is installed, virtualenv exists).

### Steps

```
1.  Try to download pre-built assets from the app's latest GitHub release
    (skipped if --force is passed, or if no release asset is found)
2.  For each app with a frontend/, install frontend JS dependencies
3.  Run bench frappe build --force
```

#### Step 1 — Pre-built asset download

`BuildCommand.run()` first attempts to download bundled frontend assets from the app's GitHub release for the current branch. If a matching release asset is found, it is extracted into `sites/assets/` and the build is skipped for that app. Pass `--force` to skip this step and always rebuild from source.

#### Step 2 — Frontend installs

`BuildCommand._install_frontend_deps()` walks `apps/` and runs `yarn install` in any `app/frontend/` directory that has a `package.json`. App-root JS dependencies are handled per-app during `bench get-app`.

#### Step 3 — Asset build

`bench frappe build --force` symlinks each app's `public/` into `sites/assets/`, runs esbuild for root-level JS, and executes each app's `build` script.

---

## `bench update`

Pulls the latest commits for all apps, reinstalls Python packages, and migrates all sites.

### Pre-conditions

- `bench init` has been run.
- All processes are stopped (warn the user if any Procfile processes are detected running).

### Steps

```
1.  Warn if processes are running
2.  For each app: git pull
3.  For each app: uv pip install -e
4.  For each site: bench migrate
```

#### Step 1 — Warn if processes are running

If `pids/bench.pid` exists and the process is alive, print a warning and ask the user to confirm before continuing. In non-interactive mode (`--yes` flag), skip the prompt and proceed.

#### Step 2 — git pull for each app

For each app discovered in `apps/`:
```
git -C apps/<name> pull
```

#### Step 3 — uv pip install -e for each app

`PythonEnvManager.install_app(app)` re-runs `uv pip install -e apps/<name>` to pick up any new Python dependencies.

#### Step 4 — bench migrate for each site

For each site discovered in `sites/`:
```
env/bin/bench --site <site.name> migrate
```

If migration fails on one site, print the error and continue with remaining sites. Exit with a non-zero code at the end if any migration failed.

---

## `bench upgrade`

Upgrades bench-cli itself to the latest version.

### Steps

```
1.  git pull in the bench-cli directory
2.  Download latest pre-built admin frontend assets
```

If the admin frontend download fails, prints a message suggesting `bench build-admin` to build from source.

---

## `bench setup config`

Regenerates all derived config files from `bench.toml` without running a full `bench init`. Use this after editing `bench.toml` to update ports, worker counts, or Redis settings.

**Files regenerated:**
- `config/redis.conf` (single-instance) or `config/redis_cache.conf`, `config/redis_queue.conf`, `config/redis_socketio.conf` (multi-instance)
- `config/Procfile`
- `sites/common_site_config.json`
- `config/nginx/*.conf` — only if `nginx.enabled = true`

**Does not:** restart processes, reload nginx, or touch apps/sites. Run `bench start` after to pick up process changes. Run `bench setup nginx` to reload nginx.

---

## `bench build-admin`

Rebuilds the admin UI frontend assets. Run this after pulling admin UI changes.

```bash
bench build-admin
```

The admin server starts automatically as part of `bench start` (via the `admin:` entry in the Procfile) and is always available at `http://localhost:8002` while the bench is running. This command only rebuilds the static assets — it does not start or stop the server.

See [docs/admin.md](admin.md) for the full interface specification.

---

## `bench setup nginx`

See [docs/production.md](production.md) for the full step-by-step.

**Summary:** Installs nginx if absent, generates per-site config files into `config/nginx/`, symlinks `include.conf` into `nginx.config_dir`, validates with `nginx -t`, and reloads nginx. Sites are discovered from the filesystem.

Pre-conditions: `nginx.enabled = true` in `bench.toml`, `bench init` has been run, process has `sudo` (Ubuntu) or Homebrew (macOS).

> **macOS note:** This command works on macOS with Homebrew nginx for local testing, but its primary use case is production deployment on Ubuntu/Linux servers. The `config_dir` default (`/etc/nginx/conf.d`) does not exist on macOS — set it to `/opt/homebrew/etc/nginx/servers/` (Apple Silicon) or `/usr/local/etc/nginx/servers/` (Intel) in `bench.toml`.

---

## `bench setup letsencrypt`

See [docs/production.md](production.md) for the full step-by-step.

**Summary:** Installs certbot if absent, ensures the webroot directory exists, runs `certbot certonly --webroot` for each site with `ssl = true` in `site_config.json` (with all domains as `-d` arguments), then regenerates nginx config with HTTPS blocks and reloads nginx.

Pre-conditions: `bench setup nginx` has run, nginx is serving port 80, DNS records for all SSL sites point to this server.

> **macOS note:** Let's Encrypt certificates require a publicly reachable server with real DNS records. This command is intended for Ubuntu/Linux production servers only.

---

## `bench setup production`

See [docs/production.md](production.md) for the full step-by-step.

**Summary:** Writes `dns_multitenant: 1` to `sites/common_site_config.json`, then runs `bench setup nginx` and `bench setup letsencrypt` in sequence.

---
