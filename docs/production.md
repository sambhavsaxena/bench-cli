# Production Setup Specification

Covers DNS-based multitenancy, Nginx reverse-proxy configuration, and Let's Encrypt SSL certificate management. All settings live in `bench.toml`.

> **Platform scope:** Everything in this file targets **Ubuntu/Linux servers**. Let's Encrypt requires a publicly reachable server with real DNS records. Nginx system integration (`/etc/nginx/conf.d/`, `systemctl reload nginx`) is Linux-specific. On macOS, use `bench run` with honcho for development; skip the `bench setup` commands entirely.

---

## Overview

A production bench differs from a development bench in three ways:

1. **Process manager** — processes run as a background daemon managed by supervisor (default) or systemd.
2. **Nginx sits in front of Gunicorn** — terminates SSL, serves static assets directly, and proxies dynamic requests to a pool of Gunicorn workers. Gunicorn runs the Frappe WSGI application with multiple workers.
3. **Each site has a real domain** — Frappe uses the `Host` header to route requests to the correct site database and files. This is called DNS multitenancy.

The `bench setup` sub-commands orchestrate these concerns:

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `bench setup production` | Configure process manager, nginx, and SSL in the correct order |
| `bench setup nginx` | Generate per-site Nginx config files and install them |
| `bench setup letsencrypt` | Obtain Let's Encrypt certificates for all SSL-enabled sites and the admin domain |
| `bench restart` | Restart all bench processes via supervisor or systemd |

---

## DNS multitenancy

Frappe identifies the current site by reading the HTTP `Host` header on every request. No per-process site assignment is needed — all web workers serve all sites from a single Gunicorn pool.

To enable this, `bench setup production` writes `"dns_multitenant": 1` into `sites/common_site_config.json`. Nginx passes the original host to Frappe via two headers:

```nginx
proxy_set_header Host              $host;
proxy_set_header X-Frappe-Site-Name $host;
```

A site whose `name` (or any entry in its `domains` list) matches the incoming `Host` header is served. If no match is found, Frappe returns a 404.

### Site name vs domains

The site `name` in `bench.toml` is the canonical hostname — it is the directory name under `sites/` and the key Frappe uses internally. Each site may also declare additional `domains` that are aliases pointing at the same site. Nginx includes all of them in the `server_name` directive and in the SSL certificate SAN list.

```
site1.example.com    ← site name (canonical)
www.site1.example.com ← domain alias
```

---

## bench.toml additions

### `production` section (required for production mode)

Adding a `[production]` section to `bench.toml` enables production mode. The section may be empty — presence alone is enough.

```toml
[production]
process_manager = "supervisor"   # none | supervisor | systemd
nginx = true                     # include nginx setup in bench setup production
use_companion_manager = false    # run scheduler/workers/socketio inside gunicorn
```

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `process_manager` | string | no | `none` | Production process manager: `none`, `supervisor`, or `systemd`. |
| `nginx` | bool | no | `false` | When `true`, `bench setup production` also runs nginx setup and (if any site has `ssl: true`) Let's Encrypt certificate issuance. |
| `use_companion_manager` | bool | no | `false` | Run scheduler, RQ workers, and socket.io as Gunicorn companion processes under a single preloaded master. Requires the Frappe Gunicorn fork with companion support. |

**Supervisor** (`process_manager = "supervisor"`, default):
- Installs `supervisor` package if not present and disables the system-wide service.
- Writes `config/supervisor/supervisord.conf` and starts a bench-owned supervisord.
- No `sudo` needed for day-to-day process management.

**Systemd** (`process_manager = "systemd"`):
- Writes `.service` files to `~/.config/systemd/user/` and a `.target` that groups them.
- Requires `sudo loginctl enable-linger <user>` once so the user session persists after logout.
- No `sudo` needed after that — `systemctl --user` manages everything.

### Companion manager

When `use_companion_manager = true`, the generated `config/gunicorn.conf.py` includes `companion_workers` for the scheduler, each RQ worker, and socket.io. Gunicorn forks a companion manager that supervises these processes, so they share the preloaded application memory copy-on-write.

In this mode the supervisor/systemd configs only manage the Gunicorn web process (plus admin and Redis). The web service gets an extended stop timeout (1600s) so Gunicorn has time to drain all companions before SIGKILL.

### `sites[]` — new optional fields

```toml
[[sites]]
name = "site1.example.com"
db_name = "site1_db"
db_password = "secret"
apps = ["frappe", "erpnext"]
domains = ["www.site1.example.com"]  # additional hostnames served by this site
ssl = true                            # obtain a Let's Encrypt cert covering name + domains
```

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `domains` | list of strings | no | `[]` | Extra hostnames that should resolve to this site. Nginx includes them in `server_name`; certbot includes them as SANs. |
| `ssl` | bool | no | `false` | When `true`, the Nginx config terminates TLS and redirects HTTP to HTTPS. Requires a cert obtained via `bench setup letsencrypt`. |

### `nginx` section (new)

```toml
[nginx]
enabled = false              # must be set to true for bench setup nginx to proceed
http_port = 80
https_port = 443
config_dir = "/etc/nginx/conf.d"   # where to write the include-pointer file (requires sudo)
worker_processes = "auto"          # passed through to nginx.conf
client_max_body_size = "50m"       # for file uploads
```

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | bool | yes | `false` | Gate that prevents accidental nginx setup in development. |
| `http_port` | int | no | `80` | Port Nginx listens on for HTTP. |
| `https_port` | int | no | `443` | Port Nginx listens on for HTTPS. |
| `config_dir` | string | no | `/etc/nginx/conf.d` | System directory where the bench include-pointer file is written. |
| `worker_processes` | string\|int | no | `auto` | Passed directly to the Nginx `worker_processes` directive. |
| `client_max_body_size` | string | no | `50m` | Maximum request body size; increase for large file uploads. |

### `gunicorn` section (new)

```toml
[gunicorn]
workers = 4                          # number of Gunicorn worker processes
threads = 4                          # threads per worker (used by gthread)
timeout = 120
worker_class = "sync"
malloc_arena_max = 2                 # cap glibc malloc arenas; 0 = unset
malloc_trim_requests = 100           # trim heap after N requests; 0 = disable
malloc_trim_interval = 300           # trim heap every N seconds, even when idle; 0 = disable
```

Gunicorn binds automatically to `127.0.0.1:<bench.http_port>` and `preload_app` is always enabled.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `workers` | int | no | `4` | Number of Gunicorn worker processes. |
| `threads` | int | no | `4` | Threads per worker. Used by the `gthread` worker class. |
| `timeout` | int | no | `120` | Request timeout in seconds. |
| `worker_class` | string | no | `sync` | Gunicorn worker class. |
| `malloc_arena_max` | int | no | `2` (new benches); `0` if absent | Caps glibc malloc arenas (`MALLOC_ARENA_MAX`) for the web/companion/worker Python processes to reduce RSS. `0` leaves the system default unset. |
| `malloc_trim_requests` | int | no | `100` | Wakes the heap-trim timer early once this many requests have been served, returning memory promptly under load. `0` disables the request trigger. |
| `malloc_trim_interval` | int | no | `300` | Interval (seconds) of a background timer thread in each web worker that calls `malloc_trim(0)` to return freed glibc heap to the OS — fires even when idle, reclaiming RSS after a transient spike. `0` disables the timer; both knobs `0` removes the hook. |

### `letsencrypt` section (new)

```toml
[letsencrypt]
email = "admin@example.com"              # required for ACME account registration
webroot_path = "/var/www/letsencrypt"    # certbot places challenge files here
```

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `email` | string | yes (if any site has `ssl: true`) | — | Contact email registered with Let's Encrypt. |
| `webroot_path` | string | no | `/var/www/letsencrypt` | Directory used for HTTP-01 ACME challenges. Must be served by Nginx at `/.well-known/acme-challenge/`. |

### `admin` section — HTTPS domain

```toml
[admin]
port = 8002
password = "your-admin-password"
domain = "admin.example.com"   # optional
```

When `admin.domain` is set and `nginx.enabled = true`:

- `bench setup nginx` generates an nginx server block that proxies the admin port on that domain.
- `bench setup letsencrypt` obtains a certificate for the domain and switches the block to HTTPS.
- HTTP requests to `admin.domain` are redirected to HTTPS automatically.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `domain` | string | no | `""` | Hostname for the admin UI. When set, nginx proxies this domain to the admin port and letsencrypt obtains a cert for it. |

### Validation additions

10. If any `sites[].ssl` is `true`, `nginx.enabled` must be `true` and `letsencrypt.email` must be present.
11. `letsencrypt.email` must match a basic email pattern if present.
12. All entries in `sites[].domains` must be valid hostnames (no spaces, no slashes).
13. `nginx.http_port` and `nginx.https_port` must be distinct integers in the range 1–65535.

## Nginx config structure on disk

```
<bench-root>/
└── config/
    ├── gunicorn.conf.py               # Gunicorn worker/bind configuration
    └── nginx/
        ├── site1.example.com.conf     # per-site server blocks
        ├── site2.example.com.conf
        └── include.conf               # single file symlinked into nginx config_dir
```

`include.conf` contains one line:

```nginx
include /absolute/path/to/bench/config/nginx/*.conf;
```

`bench setup nginx` writes one `include.conf` and symlinks it:

```
/etc/nginx/conf.d/<bench-name>.conf -> <bench-root>/config/nginx/include.conf
```

This means:
- Per-site configs stay inside the bench directory (no root needed to edit them).
- Only the symlink creation and nginx reload require `sudo`.
- Removing a site from `bench.toml` and re-running `bench setup nginx` removes its config file and the dead entry disappears automatically.

---

## Nginx config template

`NginxManager.generate_site_config(site)` produces the following for each site.

### HTTP-only site (`ssl: false`)

```nginx
# bench — site1.example.com

upstream bench-<bench-name> {
    server unix:<bench-root>/config/gunicorn.sock;
    keepalive 32;
}

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name site1.example.com;

    root <bench-root>/sites;
    client_max_body_size 50m;

    location /assets {
        try_files $uri =404;
        expires 1y;
        add_header Cache-Control "public, immutable";
    }

    location ~ ^/files/.*\.(jpg|jpeg|png|gif|svg|webp|pdf|docx?|xlsx?)$ {
        root <bench-root>/sites/site1.example.com/public;
        try_files $uri =404;
    }

    location /socket.io {
        proxy_pass         http://127.0.0.1:<redis.socketio_port>;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header   Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header   Connection "upgrade";
        proxy_set_header   Host $host;
    }

    location / {
        proxy_pass         http://bench-<bench-name>;
        proxy_read_timeout 120;
        proxy_redirect     off;
        proxy_set_header   Host               $host;
        proxy_set_header   X-Real-IP          $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-For    $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-Proto  $scheme;
        proxy_set_header   X-Frappe-Site-Name $host;
    }
}
```

### SSL site (`ssl: true`)

When a site has `ssl: true`, two server blocks are generated.

**Block 1 — HTTP (port 80)**: Serves only the ACME challenge path and redirects everything else to HTTPS.

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name site1.example.com www.site1.example.com;

    location /.well-known/acme-challenge/ {
        root <letsencrypt.webroot_path>;
        try_files $uri =404;
    }

    location / {
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    }
}
```

**Block 2 — HTTPS (port 443)**: Terminates TLS, serves assets, proxies to Frappe.

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name site1.example.com www.site1.example.com;

    ssl_certificate     /etc/letsencrypt/live/site1.example.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/site1.example.com/privkey.pem;
    ssl_protocols       TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
    ssl_ciphers         ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:
                        ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384;
    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers off;
    ssl_session_cache   shared:SSL:10m;
    ssl_session_timeout 1d;

    root <bench-root>/sites;
    client_max_body_size 50m;

    # (same location blocks as HTTP-only config above)
}
```

The cert path `/etc/letsencrypt/live/<primary-domain>/fullchain.pem` uses the site's `name` as the primary domain. All `domains` entries appear as SANs on the same certificate.

### Two-phase config generation

Generating HTTPS config before the certificate exists causes nginx to fail to start. `NginxManager` handles this with two modes:

- `generate_config(ssl_ready=False)` — writes HTTP-only blocks (safe to load before certs exist).
- `generate_config(ssl_ready=True)` — writes the full HTTP-redirect + HTTPS blocks.

`bench setup production` calls them in order:

```
1. generate_config(ssl_ready=False) → nginx reload   # port 80 only
2. LetsEncryptManager.obtain()                        # ACME over port 80
3. generate_config(ssl_ready=True)  → nginx reload   # port 80 + 443
```

## Commands

### `bench setup nginx`

**Pre-conditions:**
- `nginx.enabled = true` in `bench.toml`.
- `bench init` has been run (sites exist).
- Process has `sudo` access.

**Steps:**

```
1.  Validate bench.toml (including production validation rules)
2.  Install nginx if not present
3.  Ensure config/nginx/ directory exists
4.  For each site: generate HTTP-only config (ssl_ready=False even for ssl sites)
    — safe to load before certs exist
5.  If any SSL site already has a cert (re-run scenario): generate ssl_ready=True for that site
6.  Write config/nginx/include.conf
7.  Symlink include.conf into nginx config_dir (sudo)
8.  nginx -t to validate, then systemctl reload nginx
9.  Print the URL(s) for each site
```

Idempotent — re-running after certs are obtained upgrades each site's block to HTTPS automatically (step 5).

### `bench setup letsencrypt`

**Pre-conditions:**
- DNS records for all `ssl: true` sites (and `admin.domain` if set) point to this server.
- `letsencrypt.email` is set in `bench.toml`.

**Steps:**

```
1.  Validate bench.toml
2.  Install certbot if not present
3.  Ensure webroot_path exists (create with mkdir -p)
4.  Regenerate nginx with ssl_ready=False (HTTP-only) and reload
    — ensures all domains have a server block to serve ACME challenges
5.  For each site with ssl: true:
    a.  Run certbot certonly --webroot for site.name + domains
    b.  Skip if cert already exists and expires in > 30 days
6.  If admin.domain is set: run certbot certonly for that domain
7.  Regenerate nginx config with ssl_ready=True and reload
```

Certbot's built-in renewal timer (`certbot.timer` systemd unit, installed with certbot) handles future renewals automatically. The `--deploy-hook` ensures nginx reloads after each renewal.

### `bench setup production`

Orchestrates the full production setup in the correct dependency order.

**Pre-conditions:**
- `[production]` section present in `bench.toml`.
- `bench init` has been run.
- DNS records are configured (required before the letsencrypt step).
- Running on a Linux server (Ubuntu). Exits with an error on macOS.

**Steps:**

```
1.  Validate bench.toml
2.  Verify running on Linux (error with helpful message if macOS)
3.  Write "dns_multitenant": 1 into sites/common_site_config.json
4a. If lightweight = false (supervisor):
      Install supervisor package if absent, generate config/supervisor/supervisord.conf,
      start supervisord.
4b. If lightweight = true (systemd):
      Write ~/.config/systemd/user/*.service + *.target, run systemctl --user daemon-reload
      and enable the target.
5.  If production.nginx = true: SetupNginxCommand.run()
6.  If production.nginx = true and any site has ssl: true: SetupLetsEncryptCommand.run()
7.  Build admin frontend for production.
8.  Print summary: process status, site URLs
```

### `bench restart`

Restarts all bench processes. Works with both supervisor and systemd — auto-detected from the filesystem (no flag required).

```
1. Detect process manager:
   a. If config/supervisor/supervisord.conf exists → supervisor
   b. Else if systemd target is enabled → systemd
   c. Else error: "Run 'bench setup production' first"
2. Regenerate process manager config from bench.toml
3. Reload daemon (supervisorctl reread+update or systemctl daemon-reload)
4. Restart all processes
```

`bench upgrade` also calls restart automatically after pulling new bench-cli code, if a production process manager is configured and running.

### CLI additions

```python
@cli.group()
def setup():
    """Production setup sub-commands."""

@setup.command('nginx')
def setup_nginx(): ...           # SetupNginxCommand(bench).run()

@setup.command('letsencrypt')
def setup_letsencrypt(): ...     # SetupLetsEncryptCommand(bench).run()

@setup.command('production')
def setup_production(): ...      # SetupProductionCommand(bench).run()
```

## Admin additions

The admin interface gains two read-only sections for production visibility.

### `GET /ssl` — Certificate status

`NginxManager.cert_exists(site)` and `certbot certificates` output for each SSL-enabled site:

| Site | Domains | Cert expiry | Status |
|------|---------|-------------|--------|
| site1.example.com | site1.example.com, www… | 2025-08-19 | valid |

### `GET /nginx` — Nginx config view

Renders the content of each generated `config/nginx/<site>.conf` as a syntax-highlighted code block. Read-only — no editing via the admin.

## Admin UI — process controls

When running in production mode, the Processes page in the admin UI shows three buttons:

- **Start** — starts all bench processes (enabled when all are stopped).
- **Stop** — stops web workers and queues, leaving the admin server running.
- **Restart** — restarts web workers and queues without touching the admin server.

The admin server itself is only restarted by `bench restart` (CLI) or `bench upgrade`.
